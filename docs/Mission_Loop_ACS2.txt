ACS2 – OPEC-in-Space Mission Loop

NODES:
- MOTHERSHIP      : Depot, processor, mission control
- SKIMMER         : Single harvester vehicle
- PHASE_1_PREP    : Pre-departure prep
- PHASE_2_DEPART  : Departure burn
- PHASE_3_OUT     : Transit outbound
- PHASE_4_HARVEST : Active harvest operations
- PHASE_5_BACK    : Transit return
- PHASE_6_DOCK    : Docking
- PHASE_7_OFFLOAD : Offload & refuel
- PHASE_8_HEALTH  : Health check & relaunch/retire

- ABORT_1_SKIMMER : Skimmer self-abort
- ABORT_2_FORCE   : Mothership-forced recall
- ABORT_3_TOTAL   : Total abort (catastrophic mothership fault)

- TIMER_HEARTBEAT : Regular heartbeat / telemetry timer
- TIMER_DEATH     : 1.5× expected mission duration “death timer”

EDGES:
- MOTHERSHIP → PHASE_1_PREP → PHASE_2_DEPART → PHASE_3_OUT → PHASE_4_HARVEST
- PHASE_4_HARVEST → PHASE_5_BACK → PHASE_6_DOCK → PHASE_7_OFFLOAD → PHASE_8_HEALTH
- PHASE_8_HEALTH → PHASE_1_PREP (if skimmer deemed healthy)
- PHASE_8_HEALTH → retire skimmer (if not healthy)

ABORT PATHS:
- ABORT_1_SKIMMER (self-detected critical fault) → SKIMMER attempts best-effort return or safe disposal
- ABORT_2_FORCE (mothership-detected issue with environment or skimmer telemetry) → immediate recall, shortened mission
- ABORT_3_TOTAL (catastrophic mothership fault) → mission termination, mothership isolates damage and executes return-to-origin burn without waiting for skimmer

TIMERS:
- TIMER_HEARTBEAT → regular health pings from skimmer to mothership
- TIMER_DEATH     → if exceeded without contact, skimmer is declared lost and retired in software; mothership adjusts mission plan accordingly
