Phase 1 — Canonical README

OPEC-in-Space (Orbital Propellant Extraction & Capture)
Scope: Permission to Test. Not permission to deploy. Not permission to operationalize. Phase 1 exists to prove the system deserves to move forward.

Phase Rule

Phase 1 is bounded engineering reality-checking, not optimization and not production.
If something must work perfectly for the system to make sense, Phase 1 tries to break it.
If something fails without destroying the concept, Phase 1 documents it, contains it, and keeps going.

What Phase 1 Is

Phase 1 establishes whether OPEC is technically credible enough to justify real hardware program motion.

Phase 1 produces:

proof that the architecture behaves coherently under real constraints

proof that the single-skimmer baseline is justified

proof that abort behavior, failure modes, and mission flow are not fantasy

credible early math, not marketing math

conservative, boring, engineer-grade confidence — or a kill shot

Phase 1 answers:

Does this work at all in a world that isn’t idealized?

Is the concept internally stable, or does it collapse when examined honestly?

Is the single-skimmer demonstrator enough to prove the loop?

If it fails, does it fail cleanly instead of catastrophically?

If Phase 1 cannot answer those cleanly, Phase 1 wins by stopping the project.

Strict Boundaries (Non-Negotiable)

Phase 1 does not:

build flight hardware

build mission operations

promise mass, cost, or timelines

optimize throughput

design a fleet

chase commercial scaling

do PR, hype, or “vision decks”

pretend we’re closer to reality than we are

Phase 1 evaluates truth, not desire.

If someone tries to use Phase 1 to sell, justify program spend, or act like this is ready — Phase 1 failed culturally.

Canonical Phase 1 Objectives
1️⃣ Architectural Integrity Check

full-stack behavior consistency against physics + constraints

validate single-skimmer baseline as the canonical demonstrator

ensure skimmer/mothership roles are coherent and separable

ensure throughput framework matches architectural assumptions

confirm “simple first” doctrine holds

Output:

A stable system description that survives adversarial questioning

OR explanation of collapse

2️⃣ Failure and Abort Reality

confirm ABORT-1 / ABORT-2 / ABORT-3 logic is sane, bounded, and survivable

no hand-wave failure modes

integrity of TOTAL-ABORT doctrine

ensure failure behavior protects human program not just vehicle hardware

Output:

documented failure tree that isn’t copedium

clarity on whether failure is survivable and useful — or unacceptable

3️⃣ Thermal & Storage Credibility

validate the “four-zone” thermal control concept

passive architecture sanity check

storage behavior credibility

eclipse / idle / dock / active mode reasoning holds

Output:

A Phase-1-credible thermal narrative

Clear statement of confidence limits

4️⃣ Throughput Framework Reality

test the already-defined Step-10 throughput math against conservative inputs

ensure it doesn’t secretly rely on “hope multipliers”

demonstrate why single-skimmer baseline is enough to validate the loop

Output:

throughput math with defensible humility

clarity on what is demonstrated and what is not

5️⃣ “Can This Be Built by Real People?” Reality Pass

evaluate whether this is something normal space engineers can actually build

test whether the architecture is made of practical bricks rather than sci-fi

make sure “complexity creep” isn’t fatal

Output:

a yes/no answer with reasons

Phase 1 Success Criteria

Phase 1 is a success if:

the architecture holds under adversarial scrutiny

the failure system proves survivable and sane

single-skimmer demonstrator remains justified

thermal + throughput models remain credible, conservative, and boring

no show-stopping conceptual flaw appears

Phase 1 outstanding success if:

the concept gets more boring and more inevitable as it matures

Phase 1 Kill Criteria

Phase 1 must kill the project if:

the architecture only works if perfect conditions exist

abort and failure behavior require magic, miracle luck, or hand-waving

throughput collapses into fantasy or relies on wish math

thermal narrative cracks and cannot be salvaged without moving to Phase 3+ complexity

the single-skimmer demonstrator is no longer enough to prove the loop

the system drifts toward “giant fragile science project”

Phase 1 does not “soft fail.”
If it must die, it dies cleanly and honestly here.

Drift Prevention

To prevent bullshit creep:

If someone says “we’ll figure that out later”, Phase 1 treats it as a failure until proven otherwise.

If someone tries to scale before proving “one works,” Phase 1 rejects that path.

If someone tries to soften kill criteria, Phase 1 treats that as proof they don’t trust the system.

Phase 1 Deliverables

By the end of Phase 1, there must be:

A stable architectural document

Failure tree + abort doctrine confirmation

Thermal system credibility statement

Throughput credibility statement

Explicit “GO / NO-GO to Phase 2” determination

No marketing deck. No investor language. No politics.

Just whether it deserves to live.

Final Statement

Phase 1 exists to protect engineers, protect future budgets, and protect credibility.
If OPEC deserves to move forward, Phase 1 will make that obvious.
If it doesn’t, Phase 1 prevents everyone from wasting years pretending.
