# Phase 1 — Thermal & Storage Credibility

Purpose: Stress the four-zone thermal system and prove it holds under conservative conditions.

We validate:
- HOT spine dissipation
- COOL-STABLE storage behavior
- COLD shell + radiator coupling
- DOCK interface thermal reality

Modes evaluated:
- Active sortie
- Idle loiter
- Eclipse
- Docked dwell

Success = conservative, boring, believable passive-dominant thermal story.
Failure = requires miracles, massive active control, or nonsense radiator demands.
