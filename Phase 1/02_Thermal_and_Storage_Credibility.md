# Phase 1 — Thermal & Storage Credibility
**Status: PASSED (with honest caveats)**

---

## Judgment
The four-zone thermal system is believable under conservative assumptions.

Passive biasing + fixed radiators + PCM + storage isolation creates a credible pathway to:
- avoid catastrophic heat buildup
- maintain storage inside sane bounds
- avoid thermal chaos during docking
- ride eclipse windows without instant death

This works without magical real-time thermal choreography.

---

## Key Points

### Mode Reality
Across:
- sortie
- idle
- eclipse
- docked dwell

…there exists at least one boring, defensible thermal story for stability.

That’s what matters.

---

### Storage Reality
Storage isn’t living at razor edge.
We’re not designing a ballet.
We’re designing a refrigerator with a brain.

CO₂ storage remaining within safe pressures and temperatures across operations looks **credible**, provided conservative insulation and radiator sizing.

---

### Dock Interface Risk
Not a show-stopper.
But not trivial either.

Thermal transient management needs:
- soak handling
- staging logic
- controlled transfer windows

This is engineering work, not conceptual failure.

---

## Failure Coupling
Thermal faults flow naturally into ABORT logic.
Good sign.
No “we’d be dead before we know what’s wrong” scenarios appear conceptually.

---

## Phase 1 Conclusion
Thermal system passes **because it can be boring**.
And boring thermal systems are the ones that fly.

Result:
**GO (Phase-2 must deepen analysis, but Phase-1 confidence is real)**
