# Phase 1 — Throughput Framework Reality
**Status: PASSED (for demonstrator mission)**

---

## Judgment
Under conservative assumptions, a **single skimmer produces meaningful throughput**.

Not fantasy throughput.
Not marketing throughput.
Meaningful demonstrator throughput.

Even when:
- aborts occur
- sorties fail sometimes
- performance isn’t perfect

…the system still produces product instead of embarrassment.

## Key Findings

### Single-Skimmer Reality
It does NOT collapse to zero.
It does NOT rely on optimistic “hero math.”
It does NOT require hidden parallelism.

This matters.

---

### Abort Impact
ABORT-1 and ABORT-2 hurt productivity.
Of course they do.

But they do not annihilate throughput.
They simply create **distribution tails**, not collapse cliffs.

That’s the correct behavior profile.

---

### Propellant Closure
Doesn’t smell like a Ponzi scheme.
Under plausible mission planning and conservative margins, we are not burning everything we make just to keep the machine running.

That’s the bar.

---

## Phase 1 Conclusion
Throughput passes the “do we look like idiots when this flies?” test.

Result:
**GO**
