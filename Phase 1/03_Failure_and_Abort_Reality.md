# Phase 1 — Failure & Abort Reality
**Status: PASSED**

---

## Judgment
ABORT-1 / ABORT-2 / ABORT-3 is a real, implementable, finite logic tree.

It does not require AI sorcery.
It does not require magical foresight.
It does not require imaginary sensors.

You can hand this to a flight software team.
They wouldn’t quit.

---

## Key Findings

### ABORT-1
Local skimmer self-protection.
Detect → break sortie → return or safe.
Plausible sensors.
Plausible timing.
Finite triggers.

Good.

---

### ABORT-2
Mothership recall.
Straightforward command authority.
Simple logic.
Protects program.

Good.

---

### ABORT-3 — TOTAL ABORT
This actually shines.

It is adult, disciplined, brutally honest engineering:
If mothership dies, you *end the mission*.
You don’t pretend heroics.
You don’t attempt fantasy rescues.
You protect budget, credibility, and organizational sanity.

This is exactly what separates real engineering from demo-theater.

---

## Common-Mode Failure Check
No glaring “oops we all die” conceptual gaps.
Timing windows plausible.
Sensor classes exist in the real world.

---

## Phase 1 Conclusion
Failure & abort passes because it is:
- finite
- executable
- emotionally mature
- program-protective

Result:
**GO**
