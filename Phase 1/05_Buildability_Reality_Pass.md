# Phase 1 — Buildability Reality Pass
**Status: PASSED**

---

## Judgment
OPEC is not a fantasy project.

This is something real aerospace organizations could build.

Hard?
Yeah.
Expensive?
Yeah.
But possible?
Absolutely.

## Findings

### Technology Classes
Everything lives in familiar domains:
- GNC: normal
- thermal: challenging but sane
- storage: credible
- docking: known
- avionics: normal
- comms: normal
- propulsion: normal

No “we must invent new physics”.
No “pray for breakthrough”.

---

### Manufacturing
No bizarre exotic structures.
No “one country on Earth can make this once” requirement.
No one-off impossible fabrication.

---

### Integration Complexity
Not trivial.
But Phase-1 does not reveal “this is secretly James Webb level complexity”.
It feels like a hard, disciplined, serious mission — not a fever dream.

---

### Prototype Path
A credible demonstrator path exists.
You can stair-step this.
You don’t have to jump straight to a heroic all-or-nothing moonshot.

---

## Phase 1 Conclusion
Real engineers could build this.
Real program offices could manage this.
Real reviewers wouldn’t roll their eyes.

Result:
**GO**
