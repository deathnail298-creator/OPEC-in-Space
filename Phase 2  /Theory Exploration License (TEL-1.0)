Theory Exploration License (TEL-1.0)
1. Purpose

This license governs access to and use of theory-only materials contained in this Phase 2 directory. These materials exist solely for reading, reasoning, critique, and conceptual exploration.

This is not an open-source execution license.

2. Definitions

Theory Materials
All text, reasoning, diagrams, calculations, and conceptual content in Phase 2.

Execution
Any application of Theory Materials to real-world activity, including but not limited to:

building or prototyping

laboratory or field testing

simulation intended for implementation

manufacturing

deployment or integration

proposal, grant, or contract use

government or commercial execution

derivative works intended for execution

Intent is irrelevant — outcome controls.

Licensee
Any individual or organization accessing these materials.

3. Permitted Uses (Free)

The following are allowed without payment:

reading and reviewing

internal discussion

academic or informal critique

independent validation of logic or math

referencing ideas at a high level without implementation

These do not grant execution rights.

4. Prohibited Uses Without Execution License

Explicitly prohibited without a paid execution license:

building or prototyping

implementation-oriented simulation

testing (lab or field)

integrating into designs or programs

using in proposals, bids, grants, or contracts

government or commercial deployment

derivative execution-intended work

5. Execution License Requirement

Any execution requires a separate paid Execution License:

Base execution license fee: $5,000 USD

Additional commercial terms or royalties negotiated separately

License must be granted in writing

Phase 0 / Phase 1 rights do not waive this requirement

No execution rights exist without written approval.

6. Relationship to Other Phases

Phase 0 and Phase 1 are governed separately

Phase 2 does not modify earlier rights

Reading Phase 2 grants no execution expansion

Each phase is legally independent.

7. No Warranty

Materials are provided “AS IS.”
No claim of correctness, feasibility, safety, completeness, or suitability is made.
Use at your own risk.

8. Limitation of Liability

The author is not liable for any damages arising from use or misuse, including direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

9. Termination

Any violation terminates this license immediately.
All rights cease upon termination.

10. Acceptance

Accessing or reading these materials constitutes acceptance.
If you do not agree, do not access or use them.
