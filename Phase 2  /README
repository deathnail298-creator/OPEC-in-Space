Phase 2 — README

Operational Propellant Extraction & Cycling (OPEC)
Phase 2 — Theory Only

What Phase 2 Is

Phase 2 contains theory-only materials:

conceptual reasoning

architecture refinement

comparative analysis

stress testing frameworks

theoretical performance thinking

value framing and executive interpretation logic

Phase 2 exists to think, not to build.

What Phase 2 Is Not

Phase 2 is not permission to:

build

prototype

simulate for implementation

integrate into proposals

execute in any real-world form

Execution requires a separate paid Phase 3 Execution License.

Legal Boundary

Phase 2 is governed by the Theory Exploration License (TEL-1.0).

This license:

allows reading, discussion, critique

prohibits any form of execution or derivative execution work

explicitly separates Phase 2 from Phase 0 and Phase 1 rights

requires a paid execution license before any real-world action

Phase 0 and Phase 1 are governed independently.
Reading Phase 2 does not grant execution permission.

Full license terms are below in LICENSE_TEL-1.0.md.

Plain-English Summary

Phase 2 is the thinking layer.

You can read it.
You can analyze it.
You can argue about it.
You cannot use it to build, simulate, contract, or execute without purchasing an execution license.

LICENSE_TEL-1.0.md
Theory Exploration License (TEL-1.0)
1. Purpose

This license governs access to and use of theory-only materials contained in this Phase 2 directory. These materials exist exclusively for reading, reasoning, critique, and conceptual exploration.

This is not an open-source execution license.

2. Definitions

Theory Materials
All text, reasoning, diagrams, calculations, and conceptual work contained in this Phase 2 directory.

Execution
Any application of Theory Materials to real-world activity, including but not limited to:

building or prototyping

laboratory or field testing

simulation for implementation purposes

manufacturing

deployment or integration

proposal, grant, or contract use

government or commercial execution

derivative work intended for execution

Intent does not matter. Outcome controls.

Licensee
Any individual or organization accessing these materials.

3. Permitted Uses (Free)

The following are allowed without payment:

reading and reviewing

internal discussion

academic or informal critique

independent validation of logic or math

referencing ideas at a high level without implementation

These do not grant execution rights.

4. Prohibited Uses Without Execution License

The following are explicitly prohibited without paid execution license:

building / prototyping

simulation intended to lead to execution

testing (lab or field)

integrating into designs or programs

using in proposals, bids, or government/commercial work

deployment of any kind

derivative execution-intended work

5. Execution License Requirement

Any execution requires a separate paid Execution License.

Base execution license fee: $5,000 USD

Additional royalties or commercial terms negotiated as needed

Must be granted in writing

Possession of Phase 0 or Phase 1 rights does not waive this

No execution rights exist without written license.

6. Relationship to Other Phases

Phase 0 and Phase 1 are governed separately

Phase 2 does not modify earlier rights

Reading Phase 2 does not expand execution permission

Each phase is legally independent.

7. No Warranty

Materials are provided AS IS. No claim of correctness, safety, feasibility, completeness, or suitability is made.

Use at your own risk.

8. Limitation of Liability

The author is not liable for any damages arising from use or misuse, including direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential damages.

9. Termination

Any violation terminates this license immediately.

10. Acceptance

Accessing or reading these materials constitutes acceptance.
If you do not agree, do not access or use them.
