Phase 2 — Theory Scope

Operational Propellant Extraction & Cycling (OPEC)

OPEC exists to remove propellant dependency fragility from space mission logistics.
Phase 2 defines the theoretical architecture logic, the behavior model, and the strategic meaning of OPEC before money or engineering touches anything.

This is not about optimism.
This is about mission survival under pressure.

OPEC is fundamentally about:

removing single-channel propellant dependency

turning logistics into a managed ecosystem instead of a one-shot delivery chain

shifting propellant from “critical consumable” to “strategically recycled asset”

buying resilience instead of chasing efficiency

If nothing else from Phase 2 survives, this core sentence does:

OPEC is not a productivity engine. OPEC is a failure-resistance engine.

Everything else flows from that.

01_Assumption_Stress_Tests.md
Phase 2 — Assumption Stress Tests

Here we deliberately attack OPEC’s core premises and document what survives.

Assumption A: “Propellant logistics will inevitably be fragile”

Attack:
What if supply chains get perfect? Cheap rides. Reliable infrastructure. Plenty of launches.

Result:
Then OPEC reduces to:

insurance

stabilizer

cushion

Insurance that never cashes still has value because it was there if reality had gone the other way.

Conclusion:
Even if this assumption collapses, OPEC keeps non-zero strategic value.

Assumption B: “Iterative resource cycling is better than single-delivery logistics”

Attack:
What if cycling underperforms?
What if throughput is low?
What if recycling adds complexity yet delivers little?

Result:
OPEC converts from “solution layer” to “risk dampener”:

it stretches logistics instead of replacing them

it smooths volatility instead of carrying the mission

it absorbs shocks rather than generating capacity

Conclusion:
Even unimpressive OPEC still reduces mission volatility.

Assumption C: “Simplicity beats active optimization”

Attack:
What if highly active, AI-managed, ultra-optimized systems outperform us?

Result:
They also:

cost more to certify

fail harder when something ripples

create dependency chains

concentrate risk

Meanwhile, OPEC keeps:

stable behavior

predictable response

straightforward certification

graceful degradation

Conclusion:
Optimized beats OPEC in perfection; OPEC beats optimized in disaster.
Executives rarely get perfection. They frequently get disaster.

Assumption D: “Graceful degradation matters more than efficiency”

Attack:
Executives love sleek performance metrics.
They want numbers. Curves. Wins.

Reality:
When space missions break, they break expensively.

OPEC assumes the world is dirty, schedules slip, margins collapse, and future planners over-promise.
That assumption has historically been correct.

Conclusion:
Graceful degradation is not preference. It’s survival doctrine.

02_Failure_Extremes.md
Phase 2 — Failure Extremes

Instead of pretending failure won’t happen, we pre-define the worst shapes it can take.

Extreme Failure Case 1 — “OPEC contributes nothing”

Meaning:

it underperforms

provides trivial yield

mission planners decide it wasn’t worth it

Outcome Reality:

financial waste

political annoyance

embarrassment

But not:

mission loss

cascading system failure

catastrophic dependency collapse

This is the kind of failure executives survive.

Extreme Failure Case 2 — “OPEC works, so they over-rely on it”

This is the most dangerous real risk.

If leadership treats OPEC as:

primary supply

critical mission pillar

justification to underbuild logistics

Then the system can strand missions when expectations exceed capability.

Phase 2 conclusion:
This is prevented by doctrine, not engineering.

Extreme Failure Case 3 — “Partial internal failure”

If one region of OPEC behaves poorly:

performance degrades

system yield decays

mission schedule friction appears

But system physics don’t collapse.
Failure stays local.
It dies quietly instead of dragging the mission down.

This is intentional.

Final Failure Posture Conclusion

OPEC is designed so its worst failures are annoying, not lethal.

Executives tolerate annoying.
They fire people over lethal.

03_Constraint_Violations.md
Phase 2 — Constraint Violations

This file defines what OPEC must never become, no matter how tempting.

Violation 1 — “Turning OPEC into a throughput race”

If someone tries to “optimize it into greatness,” they will:

bolt features onto it

chase impressive graphs

stack dependencies

turn a resilience tool into a fragile showpiece

Rule:
OPEC must remain boring on purpose.

Violation 2 — “Pretending OPEC is tactical”

If someone sells OPEC as:

fast impact

immediate solution

short-term fix

Then expectations misalign, funding logic warps, and leadership makes dumb decisions.

Rule:
OPEC is strategic horizon architecture.

Violation 3 — “Complicating it into oblivion”

If someone:

adds too much intelligence

makes it dependent on smart coordination

turns it into software governance theater

Then they destroy its core reason to exist:
determinism, reliability, predictability.

Rule:
No cleverness that endangers predictability.

04_Comparative_Archetypes.md
Phase 2 — Comparative Archetypes

Context matters. OPEC must be understood relative to its neighbors.

Archetype 1 — “Deliver more propellant”

Strengths:

simple to understand

executive friendly

linear

Weakness:

fragile to interruption

single point dependency

OPEC Interaction:

does not replace delivery

stabilizes delivery reality

makes failure consequences smaller

Archetype 2 — “Build ultra-smart systems”

Strength:

looks great in PowerPoints

amazing when they work

Weakness:

catastrophic when they don’t

politically expensive failures

OPEC Interaction:

OPEC does the opposite

OPEC is not sexy

OPEC is dependable

Archetype 3 — “Do nothing”

Strength:

free
Weakness:

fragile as hell

OPEC Interaction:

exists for when “do nothing” eventually stops working

05_Long-Tail_Risks.md
Phase 2 — Long-Tail Risks

Not what’s obvious.
What creeps in quietly.

Risk — Political Drift

Once OPEC exists, leadership may subtly assume:
“You have resilience coverage now. So remove other margin.”

This is how disasters are manufactured.

Risk — Success Creates Delusion

If OPEC works well early, people will assume:
“It scales infinitely.”
“It can handle more.”
“We can depend on it.”

Success is dangerous because it erodes caution.

Risk — Cultural Rejection

Programs built on rigid planning hate systems that acknowledge fragility.
Egos don’t like insurance because insurance implies vulnerability.

This is real.

Risk — Misuse as Marketing

If OPEC ever becomes a buzzword,
it will get wrecked by overclaim culture.

Phase 2 locks language to prevent that.

06_Phase_Boundary_Analysis.md
Phase 2 — Phase Boundary Analysis

This file freezes scope discipline.

Phase 2 ends here

Phase 2 produces:

hard theoretical conclusions

strategic system framing

failure doctrine

constraint discipline

executive clarity

a stable conceptual object

Phase 2 does not produce:

designs

performance numbers

timelines

requirements

contracts

Those belong to execution phases.
